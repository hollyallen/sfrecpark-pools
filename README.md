# sfrecpark-pools
This is a tool for deciding when to swim at [San Francisco public pools](http://sfrecpark.org/recreation-community-services/aquatics-pools/).

Right now there is a web scraper, pool.py, for gathering pool swim times from [sfrecpark.org](http://sfrecpark.org) webpages. 
Next up is a nice display of the data and a useful way to filter for the times and kind of swimming you want to do.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/).
